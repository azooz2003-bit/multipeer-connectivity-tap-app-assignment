# Tap App with Multipeer Connectivity

Clone this repo on your device. I've prepared instructions across the files and a basic structure for you to work with.
You will create a tapping app that utilizes Multipeer Connectivity. You only need one screen for this.

### Instructions:
- You will build an easy tapping app that displays the number of taps made by two users connected via the framework. 
- The goal is to implement three buttons, an advertisement button that creates a session users can join / a tap button that both users can click on to increase the shared tap count / a join button which displays the list of sessions a user can join.
